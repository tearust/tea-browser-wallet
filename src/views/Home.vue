<strong style="font-size:18px;">Epoch 8 Officially Starts Jan 21, 2022</strong>
<p>
The chain will restart January 18 around 9pm PST. Do not be alarmed if you see many miners offline during the transition. Starting January 19, we will begin reissuing contest CML seeds. Once they're in your wallet, you may plant the CML into your mining machines and start bringing them back online ahead of the official January 21 epoch 8 start date.
</p>

<p>
  A snapshot of all wallets will be taken right before the chain is restarted. The snapshot will ensure users have the same amount of assets in the new epoch and will include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All users will have their TApp tokens liquidated for their underlying value according to the bonding curve (a fair distribution will be used where all owners will sell at the same price).</li>
  <li>All TEA in a user's wallet will be brought over from epoch 7.1 to epoch 8.</li>
  <li>Any unused frozen CML seeds that a user has during epoch 7.1 will be reissued as CML coupons in epoch 8.</li>
  <li>For CML mining nodes that are currently running in epoch 7.1, no matter how much life span they have left, each of these will also be reissued as CML coupons in epoch 8.</li>
</ul>

<strong style="display:block; font-size: 18px;">Investors</strong>
<p>
Investors have two ways of participating in the TEA Project ecosystem: CML and TApp token investing.

- <b>CML</b> NFTs allow holders to earn a share of a mining node's revenue when the CML is staked into a mining machine. To invest in CML, investors will follow the same procedure as miners to purchase contest CML using the <a href="https://forms.gle/jeBkBn8wDj1np92eA" target="_blank">CML purchase form</a>. To stake their contest CML, investors can pick any mining CML from the <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/top_tree_list" target="_blank">mining CML list</a> and click the <b>Stake</b> button in the <b>Actions</b> column.

- <b>TApp tokens</b> are an important investment vehicle in the TEA economy. Each TApp will have its own TApp token that investors can purchase as if investing in a stock. Each TApp token represents a share in the TApp and gives the holder dividends in the form of more TApp tokens issued to its holders whenever someone uses the TApp. As these tokens are issued on a bonding curve, the earliest TApp token investors will enjoy the largest amount of price appreciation.

To purchase TApp tokens, investors can visit the <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/tapps_list" target="_blank">TApps list</a> and click the <b>Buy</b> button in the <b>Actions</b> column for the desired TApp. The TApp tokens that the user has invested in are available to view in the <b>My investment in TApps</b> tab of the user's <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/login_account" target="_blank">My asset</a> wallet page.
</p>

<strong style="margin-top: 20px; display:block; font-size: 18px;">Disclaimer</strong>
  <ul>
<li>Please note that price appreciation of any of these assets are not guaranteed! Investors must perform their own due diligence as the price of CML and TApp tokens will fluctuate according to market conditions.</li>
  <li>Contest CML are purchased with USDT, and TApp tokens are purchased with contest TEA. Investors participating in the current testnet stage are competing for a weekly share of CML mainnet vouchers redeemable for CML when the TEA mainnet launches.</li>
  </ul>

Investors will need to first <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining-Contest:-Competitor-Checklist#install-the-polkadotjs-extension" target="_blank">install the polkadot{.js} wallet extension</a>.
Investors purchasing TApp tokens and purchasing or staking CML will incur transaction costs. TEA is used as gas on the TEA network and can be obtained by [following this guide](https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/TEA-Tokens). Investors can also <a href="http://198.199.82.222:2900/#/" target="_blank">use the faucet</a> to give them enough TEA for their first few transactions.

<p> To sign up for the mining competition, you'll need to <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/Mining-Contest:-Competitor-Checklist#install-the-polkadotjs-extension" target="_blank">install the polkadot{.js} wallet extension</a>. We have a <a href="https://github.com/tearust/teaproject/wiki/%5ENewbie-Mining-Contest-Getting-Started-Guide%5E" target="_blank">new user's guide</a> to help contestants get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Login to the TEA browser wallet and <a href="http://198.199.82.222:2900/#/" target="_blank">use the faucet</a> so you have enough TEA for your first transactions.</li>
<li>You can sign up directly through <a href="https://wallet.teaproject.org/#/leader_board">the Leader board</a> by clicking on the <strong>Register for competition</strong> button at the top of that page.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://forms.gle/jeBkBn8wDj1np92eA" target="_blank">CML purchase form</a> to buy your contest CML seeds.</li>
<li>Wait for your CML coupons to be transferred to your wallet. You'll be notified by email when they've been transferred, after which you can redeem them.</li>
<li>Take out Genesis loans with some of your CML seeds for your initial TEA necessary for the first staking slot.</li>
</ul>

  <strong style="margin-top:20px;display:block;font-size:18px;">Basic concept of plant and staking</strong>
  <p>You can use your TEA browser wallet to earn TEA tokens through mining or staking. Mining TEA requires planting a Camellia (CML) NFT into a mining machine and paying 1000T for the initial staking slot. Staking can be done on any mining machine operating on the TEA network. Each staking slot requires either 1000T or 1 CML. You may stake or unstake every 1000 blocks.</p>

  <strong style="margin-top:20px;display:block;font-size:18px;">Disclaimer</strong>
  By participating in the TEA mining contest, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
  <ul>
  <li>The CML that are purchased through the form are only for the contest and are not mainnet CML.</li>
  <li>The contest allows for many different strategies, some of which might not be profitable (i.e. there's no guarantee of profit or rewards for participating in the mining contest).</li>
  <li>The blockchain can be restarted at any time during testing which will result in your wallet balances being reset.</li>
  <li>The TEA Project team reserves the right to end the contest early or alter the rules at any time.</li>
  </ul>
