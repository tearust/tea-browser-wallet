  <h4>Basic concept of plant and staking</h4>
  <p>
    You can use your TEA browser wallet to earn TEA tokens through mining or staking. Mining TEA requires planting a Camellia (CML) NFT into a mining machine and paying <i class="iconfont icon-a-TeaProject-T" />1000 for the initial staking slot. Staking can be done on any mining machine operating on the TEA network. Each staking slot requires either <i class="iconfont icon-a-TeaProject-T" />1000 or 1 CML. You may stake or unstake every 1000 blocks.
